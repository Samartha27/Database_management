The SQLserver is run on Microsoft Azure. It is a wonderful opportunity provided to students to get familiar with the Microsoft Azure portal since it is a ubiquitous environment which many companies use all over the world. It is an amazing experience to be using this and I am extremely grateful to UW,Seattle for this opportunity. It is faster and offers a transparent experience to the students. I recommend this to all fellow students and future co-wokers.
