3a.
Decomposing R(A,B,C,D,E) using Boyce–Codd normal form with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A.
Let's consider the closure for D
X = D , X+ = {BD}
The closure does not include all the attributes. X+ = {ABCDE}
{D}+ = {B,D} which is not {D}(X ≠ X+ ) nor {ABCDE} (X+ = {ABCDE})
{ABCDE} - {BD} = {ACE}. Considering D for joining, the decomposition to this is  R1{B,D} and R2{ACDE}
We have to decompose R2.

Let's consider the closure for CE
X = CE , X+ = {ACE}
The closure does not include all the attributes. X+ = {ABCDE}
{CE}+ = {ACE} which is not {CE}(X ≠ X+) nor {ABCDE} (X+ = {ABCDE})
{ACDE} - {ACE} = {D}. Considering CE for joining, the decomposition to this is  R3{ACE} and R4{CDE}
So the decomposition is R1{B,D}, R3{ACE} and R4{CDE}.




3b.
Decomposing R(A,B,C,D,E) using Boyce–Codd normal form with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B
Let's consider the closure for A
X = A , X+ = {AE}
{A}+ = {AE} which is not {A}(X ≠ X+ ) nor {ABCDE} (X+ = {ABCDE})
{ABCDE} - {AE} = {BCD}. Considering A for joining, the decomposition to this is  R1{AE} and R2{ACDB}.
We have to decompose R2.

Let's consider the closure for BC
X = BC , X+ = {ACB}
{BC}+ = {ACB} which is not {BC}(X ≠ X+) nor {ABCDE} (X+ = {ABCDE})
{ACDB} - {ACB} = {D}. Considering CE for joining, the decomposition to this is  R3{ABC} and R4{BCD}
So the decomposition is R1{B,D}, R3{ABC} and R4{BCD}.



3c. All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.
SInce th attributes are already closed there is no need to establish any functional dependencies. The only possible way to establish functional dependency is to map each attribute to itself. A -> A, B -> B, C -> C, D -> D. All attibutes will have trivial functional dependencies.



3d. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.
A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> A 
These will make the attributes to not be closed except for {} and {A,B,C,D}.

3e. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.
C -> B, B -> C, A -> BCD, D -> ABC
